# Pressed in Thyme #

A website built using a static website generator.

## Description ##

The Pressed in Thyme website is built using a static website generator which takes the website source files and manipulates them to create the HTML and other assets used for the static website. The static website generator can be used as a starting point for a static generated site or just serve as an example of how a site of this type can be done.

## How to use ##

As a prerequisite node.js must be installed on the computer. Node.js installers can be found at https://nodejs.org and version 8 or later is recommended. Gulp version 4 or later is required.

1. Install Gulp-cli.
```
npm install -g gulp-cli
```
2. Download the zip from this GitHub repository, unzip it, rename the folder to what you want and move the folder to where you to use it.
3. Open a command prompt/terminal and cd to the folder. The gulp plugins and their dependencies first need to be installed.
```
npm install
```
After this is complete the gulp tasks can be run.
```
gulp build  //compiles and copies everything to the destination folder
gulp        //builds and runs the server
clean       //separate task to delete the destination folder only when wanted
```

For the default gulp task a browser should open with the Pressed in Thyme site.
